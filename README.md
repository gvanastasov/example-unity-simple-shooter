# Example Unity Simple Shooter

This repository contains a simple shooting game built with Unity. The game includes various features and uses several external assets.

## Game Features

- **Game Manager**: Handles game start, stop, win, lose, restart, pause, unpause, and progress. This is the central control system for the game's overall state and flow.
- **Level Manager**: Manages level generation, level toughness, and bot spawning. It dynamically adjusts the difficulty and complexity of the game based on the player's progress.
- **UI Manager**: Manages switching between UIs, UI references, and in-code interfaces. It provides a seamless and intuitive user interface experience.
- **Player**: Handles moving, rotating, shooting, and reloading. The player character is fully controllable, with a range of actions and movements.
- **Player Inventory**: Manages player bullets. It keeps track of the player's ammunition and handles reloading mechanics.
- **Enemy**: Handles idling, chasing, moving, returning, and attacking (shooting). The enemy AI is designed to provide a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
- **SightSensor**: Detects objects and provides input to EnemyFSM. It plays a crucial role in the enemy AI's decision-making process.

## Scene Description

- Uses Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for high-quality graphics and performance.
- Terrain is generated via Unity Terrain Engine, providing a realistic and immersive environment.
- Uses built-in meshes (cubes, etc.) for simple and efficient asset creation.
- Main base is created with Pro Builder Shape, allowing for quick and easy level design.
- Simple rain simulation done via Visual Effects Graph, adding atmospheric effects to the scene.
- Simple water effect done via Shader Graph, enhancing the visual realism of the environment.
- Enemy spawn area is generated by creating a navmesh (walkable area), casting it to an actual mesh (with vertices and triangles), from which a random point is taken during level generation. This ensures dynamic and unpredictable enemy spawning.
- Uses baked light maps and mixed mode for efficient and realistic lighting.

## External Assets

- **Sounds** (free):
  - Music - Sad Hope: Provides a fitting and atmospheric background music.
  - 44.1 General Library: A collection of various sound effects used throughout the game.
  - Sci-fi Guns SFX Pack: High-quality sound effects for the game's shooting mechanics.
- **GUI** (free):
  - GUI Parts: A set of UI elements used in the game's interface.
  - AllSky Free - 10 Sky/Skybox Set: A collection of skyboxes used to create diverse and visually appealing environments.
